# Third-Party Notices

OpenCode Mobile is an independent community project. It is not built,
maintained, endorsed by, or affiliated with the official OpenCode team.

This file covers everything the application ships: the fonts and native
runtimes bundled in the package, and every Dart package resolved in
`pubspec.lock`. Full license texts are in [`LICENSES/`](LICENSES/), bundled
with the app and readable in **Settings → About and open source notices**.

The local voice-input feature downloads model files only after the user
chooses a model pack. Model files are stored in app-private storage and are
not bundled with the application.

**How this file is verified.** Every version below is read from
`pubspec.lock`, not from the version constraint in `pubspec.yaml` — the two
differ, and this file previously documented `record` 6.2.1 while the app
shipped 7.1.1. Every license identifier is classified from the `LICENSE`
file inside that exact package version in the local pub cache
(`~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/<name>-<version>/LICENSE`) by matching the
license text itself, not from a package's self-declared metadata and not
from memory. Where a package's `LICENSE` carries no copyright line, the
table says so with a dash rather than inventing an owner.

## Bundled components

### Phosphor icon artwork

The regular, duotone and fill icon fonts are copied unchanged from the official
`phosphor_flutter` 2.1.0 archive, licensed under MIT, Copyright (c) 2020-2021 Phosphor Icons.
The complete license is bundled at `LICENSES/MIT-Phosphor.txt`. Native Flutter
`IconData` declarations render these fonts because the upstream Dart wrapper
extends `IconData`, which is final in our pinned Flutter 3.47.2. The package itself
is not a runtime dependency. Archive and file hashes are recorded in
`assets/fonts/phosphor/provenance.json`.

### Local SVG previews

`flutter_svg` 2.3.0 is maintained in Flutter's packages repository and is
distributed under the MIT license, with Copyright (c) 2018 Dan Field.
Its complete license is bundled unchanged at `LICENSES/MIT-flutter-svg.txt`.
The text was extracted from the exact pub.dev 2.3.0 archive after verifying
its SHA-256 against pub.dev version metadata, then matched byte for byte
against this worktree's restored package cache.
XML 7.0.1 remains the existing MIT-licensed dependency listed below; the
preview now declares it directly for its static-content validation.

The resolved SVG path also adds `path_parsing` 1.1.0 (MIT, Dan Field;
`LICENSES/MIT-path-parsing.txt`), `vector_graphics` 1.2.3 and
`vector_graphics_compiler` 1.3.0 (identical Flutter BSD 3-Clause text in
`LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause-vector-graphics.txt`), and `vector_graphics_codec`
1.1.13 (Flutter BSD 3-Clause, including its additional rights-reserved
line, in `LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause-vector-graphics-codec.txt`). All four texts
were read from the exact resolved package versions and copied unchanged.

### Photo and file selection

`image_picker` 1.2.3, `image_picker_android` 0.8.13+22, and
`image_picker_ios` 0.8.13+7 distribute identical combined Flutter BSD
3-Clause and aFileChooser Apache 2.0 notices, including Paul Burke's
copyright. Their complete, unmodified text is in `LICENSES/image-picker.txt`.

The file-selector platform packages, `flutter_plugin_android_lifecycle`,
`image_picker_for_web`, `image_picker_macos`, and
`image_picker_platform_interface` share the exact Flutter BSD 3-Clause
text in `LICENSES/flutter-file-selection.txt`. The Linux and Windows
image-picker implementations share the variant in
`LICENSES/image-picker-desktop.txt`. Versions are listed in the table below.

### sherpa-onnx

- Component: `sherpa_onnx` Flutter package and native sherpa-onnx runtime
- Version: 1.13.6
- Project: https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx
- Copyright: sherpa-onnx contributors, including Xiaomi Corporation notices in
  the distributed source
- License: Apache License 2.0; see `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`

sherpa-onnx performs the local Whisper decode and supplies the native libraries
for Android ABIs through its `sherpa_onnx_android_*` packages.

### ONNX Runtime

- Component: ONNX Runtime native inference runtime used by sherpa-onnx
- Version provenance: sherpa-onnx 1.13.6 declares ONNX Runtime 1.27.1 in its
  release changelog for the packaged native runtime
- Project: https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime
- Copyright: Microsoft Corporation
- License: MIT; see `LICENSES/MIT-ONNX-Runtime.txt`

### record

- Component: `record` Flutter package and its platform implementations
  (`record_android`, `record_ios`, `record_linux`, `record_macos`,
  `record_web`, `record_windows`, `record_platform_interface`)
- Version: 7.1.1 (`pubspec.lock`; the constraint in `pubspec.yaml` is also
  pinned to 7.1.1)
- Project: https://github.com/llfbandit/record
- License: BSD 3-Clause; see `LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause-record.txt`

The license file distributed in the 7.1.1 pub package carries the notice
"Copyright 2022 openapi4j authors. All rights reserved." — an upstream
artifact of the package's own history, not a claim by this project. That file
is reproduced byte for byte, comment markers included, in the license text
referenced above. The same text ships in every `record_*` platform package.

### scrollable_positioned_list

- Component: `scrollable_positioned_list` Flutter package
- Version: 0.3.8
- Project: https://github.com/google/flutter.widgets/tree/master/packages/scrollable_positioned_list
- Copyright: 2018 the Dart project authors, Inc.
- License: BSD 3-Clause; see
  `LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause-scrollable-positioned-list.txt`

This package supplies stable indexed scrolling for long, mixed-height message
timelines.

### mobile_scanner, and the Android libraries it pulls in

- Component: `mobile_scanner` Flutter package
- Version: 7.4.0
- Project: https://github.com/juliansteenbakker/mobile_scanner
- Copyright: 2022 Julian Steenbakker
- License: BSD 3-Clause; see `LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause.txt`

This package reads the QR code that `opencode2 pair` prints. It is listed
here as well as in the inventory table because, unlike the other Dart
packages, it causes Google-authored native libraries to be compiled into the
Android APK. Its Gradle module declares:

- `com.google.mlkit:barcode-scanning` 17.3.0 — the barcode decoder, **with
  the detection model bundled into the APK**. This is the package's default;
  the alternative (`play-services-mlkit-barcode-scanning`, model downloaded
  on demand via Google Play Services) is not used, so scanning works on a
  device with no Play Services and with no first-run download. The cost is a
  larger APK, stated here rather than left to be discovered.
- `androidx.camera:camera-lifecycle` and `androidx.camera:camera-camera2`
  1.6.1 — CameraX, which drives the preview.
- `org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android` 1.11.0.

All of the above are Apache License 2.0; see `LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`.
ML Kit is additionally covered by Google's ML Kit terms of service. None of
these are used anywhere else in the app: the camera is opened only by the
pairing scanner, only while that screen is on top, and no frame is stored.

### JetBrains Mono

- Component: JetBrains Mono font files bundled under `assets/fonts/`
- Version: distributed TTF builds from the upstream repository
- Project: https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono
- Copyright: 2020 The JetBrains Mono Project Authors
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1; see
  `LICENSES/OFL-1.1-JetBrains-Mono.txt`

These font files render code, terminal output, paths, and other monospace
content throughout the application.

### Space Grotesk

- Component: Space Grotesk font files bundled under `assets/fonts/`
- Version: static TTF instances as served by Google Fonts
- Project: https://github.com/floriankarsten/space-grotesk
- Copyright: 2020 The Space Grotesk Project Authors
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1; see
  `LICENSES/OFL-1.1-Space-Grotesk.txt`

These font files render headlines and titles: the one display face the
product uses beyond the platform default.

### Flutter SDK

- Component: the Flutter framework and engine, and the SDK-sourced packages
  `flutter`, `flutter_localizations`, `flutter_web_plugins`, `sky_engine`
  (and `flutter_test`, which is not shipped)
- Version: 3.47.2, the revision pinned for Shorebird releases
- Project: https://github.com/flutter/flutter
- Copyright: 2014 The Flutter Authors. All rights reserved.
- License: BSD 3-Clause; see `LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause.txt`. The engine
  additionally bundles its own third-party notices, which Flutter surfaces
  through `showLicensePage`.

### OpenAI Whisper and converted ONNX model files

The downloadable INT8 ONNX files are conversions of multilingual OpenAI
Whisper model weights. OpenAI states that Whisper code and model weights are
released under the MIT License. The OpenAI Whisper MIT text and attribution are
in `LICENSES/MIT-OpenAI-Whisper.txt`.

The application does not modify or redistribute model bytes. The converted
encoder, decoder, and tokenizer files are hosted by `csukuangfj` on Hugging
Face and are fetched from immutable repository revisions:

- `csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-whisper-small` at
  `8f3c18b358db4d1f2fc1eae49d75cd20989e4309`
- `csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-whisper-base` at
  `bb53ee204431c90d314c1cc08d28d23e5b7927cc`
- `csukuangfj/sherpa-onnx-whisper-tiny` at
  `65176e2deb88badc814a94058666cadccc29b61c`

The application verifies every downloaded file against the byte length and
SHA-256 digest pinned in `lib/voice/model_manifest.dart`. Neither Hugging Face,
OpenAI, nor the sherpa-onnx project endorses this application.

## Package inventory

Every hosted package resolved in `pubspec.lock`, at the exact version
resolved. "Role" is `runtime` for packages reachable from the application's
own dependency graph and `test-only` for packages reached solely through
`dev_dependencies`; test-only packages are not shipped in the APK or the
desktop bundle and are listed for completeness. Some runtime packages are
platform implementations for iOS, macOS, Windows, or web and are therefore
resolved but not compiled into the Android or Linux builds.

License texts: `LICENSES/MIT.txt`, `LICENSES/BSD-3-Clause.txt`,
`LICENSES/Apache-2.0.txt`, `LICENSES/MPL-2.0.txt`. Per-package copyright
lines are in the table.

`opencode_sdk` is generated from this repository's own OpenAPI contracts,
lives in `packages/opencode_sdk/`, and is covered by this project's
[MIT license](LICENSE) — it is not third-party and is not listed below.

### Notes on individual entries

- **`dbus` (MPL-2.0)** is reached only through `flutter_secure_storage_linux`
  and is therefore present in the Linux desktop build, not the Android APK.
  It is used unmodified; MPL-2.0 source for it is available from the package
  on pub.dev. Its `LICENSE` is reproduced in full at `LICENSES/MPL-2.0.txt`.
- **`record` and every `record_*` package** ship the openapi4j-attributed
  BSD-3-Clause notice described above.
- **Apache-2.0 and MPL-2.0 packages** distribute the unmodified license text
  with no per-package copyright line, so the copyright column shows a dash.
  Attribution for those packages is the package name and version in this
  table.
- **`shorebird_code_push`** distributes the plain MIT text with no copyright
  line of its own.

## Runtime and model data flow

The `record` plugin supplies PCM16 microphone samples. The application passes
those samples to sherpa-onnx, which executes the converted Whisper ONNX graphs
with ONNX Runtime on CPU. Downloaded model files remain in app-private storage;
captured audio is held only for the active transcription and then discarded.

## Regenerating this file

The inventory is derived from `pubspec.lock` and the pub cache. When
dependencies change, re-derive it rather than editing rows by hand: for each
hosted entry in `pubspec.lock`, read
`~/.pub-cache/hosted/pub.dev/<name>-<version>/LICENSE`, classify the license
from the text, and take the copyright line from that same file. A package
with no `LICENSE` in its published archive must be checked on its pub.dev
page before it is listed.
