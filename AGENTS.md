# AGENTS.md

Working notes for coding agents in this repo. The human-facing equivalents are
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (gates, boundaries) and
[docs/technical-overview.md](docs/technical-overview.md) (architecture depth).

## Toolchain — pinned, not advisory

- Flutter **3.47.2** from Shorebird's cache:
  `~/.shorebird/bin/cache/flutter/<rev>/bin/flutter`. A different local Flutter
  may fail to resolve packages or produce different analyzer results.
- JDK 17 (temurin), Android SDK API 37, Shorebird CLI 1.6.x (release/patch only).

## Commands and order

These are the **stable integration-candidate gates**, not a loop to repeat after
every edit. During development, follow the focused-check ladder below.

```bash
flutter pub get
flutter analyze                 # must be clean; no new ignores
flutter test --concurrency=1    # serial — parallel runs are flaky or killed
```

- Single file: `flutter test --concurrency=1 test/offline_queue_test.dart`.
- If the shell kills long runs, split the suite — do not parallelize:
  `ls test/*.dart | split -n l/6 - /tmp/chunk_`, then run each chunk.
  Include nested test directories too; a top-level glob is not the full suite.
- Generated SDK package has its own checks: `dart analyze` and `dart test`
  inside `packages/opencode_sdk/`.
- Optional live-server checks (no emulator):
  `opencode serve --port 4123 &` then
  `dart run tool/smoke_test.dart http://127.0.0.1:4123 /server/project`;
  `tool/prompt_test.dart` additionally needs model auth.
- Android compile check: `flutter build apk --release`. Debug APKs **do not
  work** against the Shorebird-pinned engine (release engine jars only).
  Without `android/key.properties` the build fails at `validateSigningRelease` —
  that still proves the Kotlin and Dart sides compile.

## Testing traps

- Any test touching `ProfileStore.load`/`upsert` must mock the
  `plugins.it_nomads.com/flutter_secure_storage` method channel or it hangs
  forever. Copy the pattern from `test/offline_queue_test.dart`.
- Widget keys exist only where a test needs a handle; find by user-visible
  text otherwise. Tests assert behavior, not implementation.
- `flutter_animate` is banned (pending timers fail widget tests). Use the
  framework's animation APIs.

## Architecture boundaries

- `lib/api/` OpenCode 1 client (generated SDK + SSE `/event`);
  `lib/api2/` handwritten OpenCode 2 client (Basic auth, `/api` prefix,
  91-event union, durable session log);
  `lib/domain/` protocol-neutral gateway (`ServerGateway`,
  `ServerOperationsGateway`, `ServerCapabilities`);
  `lib/state/` profiles/Keystore, `ConnectionController`, offline queue;
  `lib/termux/`, `lib/background/`, `lib/voice/`, `lib/platform/` native
  bridges; `lib/ui/` screens and widgets.
- UI talks to the domain gateway only — never `api/` or `api2/` directly.
  Gate features on `ServerCapabilities` flags, never on the flavor enum.
- Treat as single-owner units (one editor at a time): `lib/state/connection.dart`,
  `lib/ui/screens/chat_screen.dart` **plus every `chat/*.dart` part file as one
  library**, `lib/domain/server_gateway.dart`, `lib/api/product_repository.dart`,
  `lib/main.dart`, `lib/l10n/` output, each protocol cluster, and both halves of
  any MethodChannel (`oc/termux`, `oc/voice`, `oc/camera`, `oc/background`,
  `oc/share`).
- OpenCode 2 event stream is volatile: after reconnect, reconcile by refetch,
  not replay (the beta session log replays only durable events; deltas and
  `tool.progress` never replay). Wire truth: `docs/opencode2-protocol-notes.md`.

## Security invariants — breaking these is a security regression

- Every URL the app did not author goes through `openExternalLink`
  (`lib/ui/widgets/external_link.dart`). Never `launchUrl` a value from a
  server, form field, or network response.
- Per-profile storage keys must be named `oc.<what>.<profileId>` so the
  deletion sweep in `ProfileStore.profileScopedPreferenceKeys` finds them;
  extend `ConnectionController.deleteProfileAndLocalData` for shared blobs.
- Never echo provider credentials: `/config/providers` returns API keys — they
  must not reach logs, diagnostics, notification copy, or test output.

## Repo-specific facts

- `packages/opencode_sdk/` is generated from `contracts/` via
  `tool/sdk/generate.sh`. Never hand-edit; CI fails on drift.
- Nothing in `lib/background/` may assume unbounded lifetime: Android 15+
  caps `dataSync` foreground services at 6 background hours per rolling 24h,
  and the battery-optimization exemption does not lift that.
- App is English-only; `l10n.yaml`/`app_en.arb` are wired but most strings are
  still hardcoded (`docs/localization-todo.md`).
- Verifying against a live OpenCode 2 beta: `opencode2 serve --port 4097
  --hostname 127.0.0.1`, HTTP Basic user `opencode` with the per-run password
  it prints — never commit or echo that password.
- `.claude/skills/` is gitignored third-party content. Do not commit it.
- The Termux-hosted dev container shares the phone with the live session
  server: never kill processes by pattern — `pkill -f "opencode serve"`
  matches the session's own server and drops the connection. Capture and
  kill test servers by exact PID, and check listeners by port or
  `ps -p <pid>`, not by matching command lines.

## Workflow

- Maintainer instruction (2026-09-08): new features use one dedicated branch and
  Git worktree per agent. That agent owns the complete user journey, implementation,
  localization, tests, screenshots and local commits. The coordinator reviews the
  complete branch, resolves integration conflicts and merges after validation.
  Keep each worktree to one feature; do not edit another agent's checkout. This
  supersedes direct-on-dev development for new features and file-by-file delegation.
  Use `[skip ci]` in commits; no automatic pushes, CI, signing or releases. Serialize
  machine-heavy Flutter/native checks across worktrees, while source work proceeds
  independently. Shared-library single ownership applies within each worktree.

- Maintainer instruction (2026-09-07): consolidate work in logical staged commit batches directly on `dev`, with `[skip ci]` in every commit message to preserve the CI budget. Do not open PRs or trigger native workflows for this consolidation. Run checks locally; CI/signing runs require a fresh explicit request. This instruction overrides the default PR workflow below for this batch.

- Replacement APKs for the maintainer must keep the installed stable CI signer: `2D010C2103CB2F78ABAACA690EAD4D45F8003A6C0A02082CD2A2AE62FD18D0EC`. Use the Android quality workflow for these updates, verify the APK certificate before delivery, and never substitute or rotate the signer.

- Work lands on `dev` through PRs; `master` is fast-forwarded only at approved
  milestones — see `docs/verification/` for the branch ledger.
- Releases/signing go through `scripts/release.sh` / `scripts/cut-alpha.sh`
  (master-only, clean tree, dry-run by default). Never publish, tag, or use
  signing secrets without explicit maintainer approval.
- PRs need: tests + local serial `flutter test` result, screenshots for UI
  changes, accessibility notes, privacy/security notes for credential/data
  changes, migration notes for stored-format changes.

## Productivity rules — finish usable slices

1. **One active product slice.** Write a one-sentence finish line and an explicit
   non-goal before editing. Finish controller → UI → persistence/deletion before
   opening another feature. A scaffold or opt-in backend is groundwork, not a
   completed user feature. Example: stash is done when save → restart → restore
   → profile deletion works, not when the vault class exists.
2. **Check feasibility before building adapters.** Confirm the current callable
   contract, supported authentication and permitted credential use first. A
   historical schema/internal endpoint is not enough. If the prerequisite fails,
   keep the feature unavailable and move to runnable product work; do not build
   a workaround first and withdraw it later.
3. **Timebox discovery.** Start with current source and existing evidence. Target
   ten minutes for a bounded question; then implement, name a blocker, or explain
   why more research is necessary. Reopen research only for a new contradiction,
   changed contract or unresolved implementation decision—not another summary.
4. **Parallelize execution, not repeated audits.** For substantial work, use at
   least three independent slices when ownership permits. Freeze method names,
   arguments, results and errors before parallel editing. Record read/write
   sets, dependency, acceptance and focused checks. Shared libraries remain
   single-owner. Reviewers never launch test processes. If a worker is blocked
   by quota/permissions, take over that slice; do not spend the session building
   a nested-worker workaround or claim a foreground tool is background work.
5. **Use a check ladder.** Format changed files; run the new/affected test file
   once the logical change is ready. After a failure, rerun that file or exact
   test (`--plain-name`) until fixed—not the repository. Run the analyzer at an
   integration checkpoint. Generate localization once after copy settles. Docs-
   only changes need a diff/link check, not Flutter tests.
6. **Budget the final gate before starting it.** This environment's serial suite
   has taken 27–40 minutes. At the agreed stable batch boundary, run the required
   full suite in bounded serial chunks from a complete test-file manifest,
   including nested goldens. Record candidate revision/diff, commands, completed
   files, skips and failures. If interrupted, resume only uncompleted files for
   the unchanged candidate. Subsequent relevant edits invalidate that coverage;
   never combine incompatible snapshots into a claimed pass. Do not repeat a
   40-minute monolithic timeout or call partial coverage a completed gate.
7. **Keep an evidence budget.** Progress updates should say what now works, what
   remains, and the next concrete action. Append verification results at the
   slice boundary; do not rewrite the roadmap or produce a new audit packet
   after each small edit. Record unexpected blockers once and return to code.
8. **Separate shipping states.** Report implemented / enabled / verified /
   committed / deployed / released distinctly. Lines changed and test counts
   are not user value. Native CI, signing and publication cannot substitute for
   unfinished product integration. “Get shipping” is not permission to touch
   live servers, credentials, tags, signing keys or public releases; obtain the
   required explicit approval and stay on `dev`.
