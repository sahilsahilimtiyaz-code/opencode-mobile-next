# Independent review: managed OC1/OC2 switch

Reviewed 2026-09-09T18:40:14.859154+00:00 at owner worktree `/home/eslam/Storage/Code/oc_app-oc2-managed-switch`, base881e0d1 plus uncommitted switch changes. Source-only bounded review: no tests, processes, installations, credential/config reads or source edits by reviewer. Owner's final corrections inspected after feedback; this is not a runtime/test pass.

**Result: identified source issues corrected; no remaining blocking finding in the reviewed scope.** Final owner checks and actual Termux switch/revert remain separate acceptance gates. Pinned18600 Linux host isolation/auth proof is recorded in [upstream-feasibility.md](upstream-feasibility.md); it is not Android proof.

| ID | Finding sent to owner/root | Final correction reviewed | State |
|---|---|---|---|
| OCSW-REV-01 | Journal was deleted before `write_state ready`, losing transition metadata if ready persistence failed or process died between writes. | `bridge.dart:1661–1666` writes authenticated ready first, sets setup success, then performs nonfatal journal cleanup. Journal now records operationID (`:1738–1743`); `status():1976–1983` finishes cleanup only for matching ready operation and target marker, after normal tracked-process validation. | Corrected in source; focused failure-boundary tests belong to owner. |
| OCSW-REV-02 | Return trusted an edited/stale profile password and could overwrite preserved runtime authentication. | `bridge.dart:1784–1787` compares staged credential against existing preserved `password-$target` before stopping the server; mismatch refuses the operation. `termux_setup_screen.dart:330–332` returns an existing target profile unchanged. No credential bytes logged/read by reviewer. | Corrected in source. |
| OCSW-REV-03 | Initial OC1→OC2 could proceed with no previous local profile credential, then discover Return unavailable. | `termux_setup_screen.dart:388–392` requires a nonempty previous-runtime profile credential before transport preparation or dispatch, and requires OC1 target credentials on return. | Corrected in source. |
| OCSW-REV-04 | Newly added bare return inside timeout helper's Future<bool> was not a valid result. | `_recoverPersistedSetupAfterTimeout` returns true at the passive-ready branch. Same passive/remote-active connection guard is now also present in ordinary `_refreshStatus`. | Corrected in source; analyzer gate not run by reviewer. |

## Reviewed preserved boundaries

- **Data paths:** `bridge.dart:898–919` puts switched OC2 under `/root/.oc-opencode2` via four XDG variables, explicit OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR and absolute OPENCODE_DB; conflicting OPENCODE_CONFIG/CONTENT are removed. This matches exact published util18600 support and independently executed pinned host DB proof. Shared project files/config are disclosed, and no automatic history/provider credential migration is attempted.
- **Pre-existing first-run OC2:** empty/default data-mode stays on existing default roots; attempted OC1 return is refused before stop (`bridge.dart:1779–1783`). Only an OC1-owned installation opting into OC2 receives isolated mode (`:1802–1808`). Existing default-data OC2 is not silently moved to an empty isolated database.
- **Crash ownership:** prior credential copied before the journal and only when no journal already exists; an interrupted target-password write cannot be relabeled as the previous runtime. Target preparation precedes bounded stop; runtime marker and target password commit precede launch, with journal retained across both boundaries. Status emits actual runtime marker while transition is pending rather than treating package-staging state as slot ownership.
- **Process targeting:** existing `server_process`, `stop_verified_server_process` and `group_is_managed_tree` require exact runner arguments, PID start-time identity and descendant group ownership before terminating the managed process tree (`bridge.dart:1132–1166`). No broad name/pattern kill was introduced. Port4096 reuse follows a bounded released-port check; a distinct port is not required by this one-server design.
- **Recovery and profiles:** `connection.dart:2175+` refuses known in-flight/pending managed work, persists recovery disablement, checks again, durably clears remembered local connection then disconnects it. Remote connections remain separate. `_redetectFlavor` does not mutate a saved managed profile into the other runtime. Existing profile IDs, drafts and credentials are preserved.
- **Failure/Return UI:** switch operation IDs reject stale previous-ready snapshots; pending journal offers explicit Retry/Return and suppresses automatic recovery/setup shortcuts. Missing/mismatched credentials fail with a recovery explanation rather than generate/rotate an old runtime password. This remains a refusal path if the user's saved credential is already stale; automatic secret recovery is not implemented or claimed.

## Evidence limits

Owner's shell tests mock server start/stop and package install. They are useful behavioral coverage but cannot prove Android/proot execution, real process-tree termination or actual provider/session preservation. Reviewer ran none. Exact final test/analyzer/native results must be linked by coordinator after owner commits. This review authorizes no live mutation, credential migration, signing or release.
