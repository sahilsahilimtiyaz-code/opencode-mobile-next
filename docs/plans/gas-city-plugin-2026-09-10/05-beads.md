# Beads — epic and tasks for ralph-tui

Conventions: prefix `TEAM-`; sizes fit one ralph-tui run; every bead ends
with the repo's quality gates:

- `flutter analyze --no-pub` → No issues found
- `flutter test --no-pub --concurrency=4 <touched suites>` green (full suite at each sprint end)
- `python3 tool/assemble_arabic_arb.py` → missing 0, mismatches 0; `flutter gen-l10n`
- `dart format` on changed files
- 320dp × 2.5x LTR + RTL layout test for any new screen

Dependencies use `bd dep add <bead> <depends-on>`.

## Epic

**TEAM-000 · AI Team (Gas City) as an optional plugin**
PRD: `docs/plans/gas-city-plugin-2026-09-10/01-prd.md`. UX:
`02-ux-flows-and-screens.md`. Architecture: `04-plugin-architecture.md`.
Gate: `06-decisions-and-readiness.md` must be fully ticked before any bead
after TEAM-002 starts.

## Gate spikes (evidence only, no product code)

### TEAM-001: Spike — Gas City on the dev PC, spec pin, fixture recording
As the owner, I want a real Gas City running on the Ubuntu host with the API
recorded so that every later bead codes against a pinned truth.

### Impact Table
| Path | Change | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| contracts/gascity-supervisor-openapi-v0-<sha>.json | create | Pinned spec snapshot | from `GET /openapi.json` of the installed build |
| tool/qa/gascity_fixture/recordings/*.json | create | Recorded responses: health, cities, rigs, runs, run, beads, graph, agents, agent, sessions, pending, usage | secrets scrubbed |
| tool/qa/gascity_fixture/events/*.ndjson | create | Event logs: normal run, blocked, failed, stream drop | |
| docs/qa/ai-team/spike-pc-2026-09.md | create | Commands run, versions, what worked, what did not | |

Acceptance Criteria:
- [x] `gc version`, `gc doctor`, `gc supervisor start` outputs recorded; supervisor version and city name noted
- [x] `curl /health`, `/v0/cities`, `/v0/city/<c>/{rigs,agents,beads,runs,usage}` captured with response shapes matching `gas-town-findings.md` §2.2 or the differences listed
- [ ] A run created by `gc sling --formula` and a convoy created by the Mayor both appear in recordings
- [x] `events/stream` captured with `seq` and `Last-Event-ID` resume verified
- [ ] `tailscale serve --bg 8372` reachable from the phone over HTTPS (blocked: Serve not enabled on the tailnet); plain HTTP bind refused by `gc` documented ✔
- [x] Open questions 5, 7, 13 in `06-decisions-and-readiness.md` answered from evidence (06 §F); 1–3, 8, 12 unchanged by the spike

### TEAM-002: Spike — Gas City inside the on-device proot rootfs (arm64)
As the phone-first user, I want to know whether an AI team can run inside
the Linux environment the app already installs, so that the onboarding step
is real or absent.

### Impact Table
| Path | Change | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| docs/qa/ai-team/spike-phone-2026-09.md | create | Evidence and verdict | |
| scripts/termux/aiteam-spike.sh | create | Reproducible spike script for the rootfs | not shipped in the app |

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] `gascity_<ver>_linux_arm64.tar.gz` checksum-verified and `gc version` runs under proot on the phone rootfs and on the emulator arm64 image if available
- [ ] `apt install tmux git jq procps lsof` succeeds in the rootfs; `gc doctor` output recorded
- [ ] `gc init` with the managed Dolt store (`bd` ≥ 1.0.4 and `dolt` arm64 inside the rootfs; `GC_BEADS=file` is ruled out by TEAM-001 §4.1) + `gc start` on `127.0.0.1:8372` answers `/health` and `/v0/cities` with `running=true`
- [ ] One agent using the on-device OpenCode harness (`opencode acp`) completes one trivial bead; whether its session is visible on the managed OpenCode server recorded (decides `sessionLink`)
- [ ] Loopback write path tested: does a mutation need a grant on loopback? Recorded
- [ ] Memory/CPU/battery observations over 30 min screen-off recorded; what Android kills and how the manager recovers
- [ ] Verdict line: PASS (Sprint C proceeds) or FAIL with reasons (Sprint C becomes copy-only)

## Sprint B — Answer and steer

### TEAM-115: Quiet the noise (first phone use, 2026-09-11)
Owner verdict on the first real screen: "so confusing". Hide the pack's
upkeep runs (`mol-*-patrol`, orders, nudges), name a batch by its work
item's title instead of `sling-<id>`, give a batch an honest state
("Waiting for an agent" rather than "Planning"), count and draw only live
agents (empty pool slots and suspended helpers are not agents), and name the
host (pop-os / 100.126.15.6) in the chip instead of the OpenCode server.

### TEAM-116: Dispatch cycle — show the steps moving
Owner request 2026-09-11: "logically intercept the steps and render them in
a nice way so the user can know that the cycle is moving."

As a phone user who just started a task, I want to see which step the team
is on and why it is waiting, so that a two-to-six-minute dispatch never
looks like nothing is happening.

### Impact Table
| Path | Change | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| lib/orchestration/models/dispatch_cycle.dart | create | `DispatchStep` enum (routed, agentStarting, claimed, working, pushed, handedToMerge, merged) + `DispatchCycle` (step, since, stalled, stallReason) | derived, never fetched |
| lib/orchestration/adapters/gascity/gascity_mappers.dart | modify | Derive the cycle per work item from bead metadata + sessions + timeline events | evidence table below |
| lib/state/orchestration.dart | modify | Keep per-work step timestamps from events (append-only), expose `cycleFor(workId)`; stall detection timers | |
| lib/ui/widgets/team_cycle_strip.dart | create | Six-step strip: done ✓, current pulsing (static under reduced motion), future dim; timestamps; "usually 1–5 min" hint on Agent starting; stall sentence + one action | |
| lib/ui/widgets/team_card.dart, lib/ui/screens/team/run_screen.dart, lib/ui/screens/team/work_sheet.dart | modify | Strip on the card's headline batch, on the run Overview (replaces "Stages" for a batch), and in the Work sheet | |
| lib/l10n/app_en.arb, docs/qa/ai-team/messages_ar-cycle.json | modify/create | `teamUiCycle*` | |
| test/team_cycle_test.dart | create | Derivation from the recorded normal-run log; stall reasons; rendering states | |

Evidence → step:
- Routed: `bead.updated` with `metadata.gc.routed_to` (or the bead already carries it)
- Agent starting: `session.woke` for a session of the routed template in the rig; or a polecat session appearing in `/sessions`
- Claimed: `bead.updated` → status in_progress with `assignee`
- Working: agent output growing, or `metadata.gc.work_dir` / worktree present
- Pushed: `metadata.branch` set
- Handed to merge: assignee = the rig's refinery
- Merged: `bead.closed` or `close_reason` merged, or the run completed

Stall reasons (shown after the step's usual window):
- Routed > 3 min without Agent starting → "The host has not started an agent yet" · action: Refresh / "How the host dispatches" sheet
- Agent starting flapping (woke/stopped within 60 s, 2+ times) → "The agent could not start on the host" · action: open host guide
- Claimed/Working with the transcript containing "usage limit" / "quota" / "rate limit" → "The model provider reached its usage limit" · action: Open agent output; Stop
- Working > 30 min without Pushed → "Still working — check the agent's output" · action: Open output
- Handed to merge > 15 min → "Waiting for the merge agent" · action: Nudge refinery (when controls exist)

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Over the recorded `normal-run` event log the derived steps are Routed 22:44:52 → Agent starting 22:44:59 → Claimed 22:46:34 → Pushed 22:51:04 → Handed to merge 22:53:47, in order, with those timestamps
- [ ] A batch that only has Routed shows "Waiting for an agent · usually 1–5 min" with the current step pulsing; reduced motion → static
- [ ] Each stall reason renders its sentence and action; the usage-limit reason is detected from a transcript containing "usage limit has been reached"
- [ ] Strip fits 320 dp at 2.5× (steps wrap to two rows), LTR and RTL, English and Arabic
- [ ] Quality gates

| lib/l10n/app_en.arb, docs/qa/ai-team/messages_ar-storage.json | modify/create | `termuxStorage*` keys | |
| test/termux_storage_test.dart | create | Parsing, categories, confirmation, never-delete list | |

Categories (measured on the owner's phone, 2026-09-11):
- **Build caches** — rootfs `/root/.gradle/{caches,wrapper}`, `/root/.pub-cache`,
  `/root/.cache`, `/root/.dartServer`, `~/.npm`, `~/.cache` (11.6 GB)
- **Agent scratch** — rootfs `/tmp/opencode/*` (11 GB, 136 dirs), Termux
  `$PREFIX/tmp`
- **Project build outputs** — `build/`, `.dart_tool/`, `node_modules/`,
  `target/` inside `/root/projects/*` (most of IPTV_King's 3.6 GB)
- **Toolchains** — `/usr/lib/android-sdk`, `/usr/lib/jvm`, Flutter SDK
  copies under `/tmp/opencode` (about 6 GB); shown with "only if you build
  Android apps on this phone"
- **AI Team** — city dirs, Dolt store, polecat worktrees, `gc`/`bd`/`dolt`
  binaries (about 0.6 GB)
- **OpenCode itself** — node_modules, auth, sessions DB (never offered for
  cleaning here; sessions have their own screen)
- **Projects (your files)** — listed, never deletable from this screen

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Scan shows total, per-category size and the exact paths that a clean
      would remove; scan runs in the background with the same live-output
      panel as install, and is cancellable
- [ ] Clean is per category, two-step for anything over 1 GB, shows freed
      bytes afterwards, and never touches `/root/projects/<name>` sources,
      OpenCode's auth/sessions, or the Termux packages the server needs
- [ ] A category with a running process using it (Gradle daemon, dolt,
      supervisor) refuses with the process name
- [ ] Copy is honest about regeneration ("the next build will download
      these again")
- [ ] Quality gates

### TEAM-305: Running servers and processes on this phone (Termux server manager)
Owner request 2026-09-11 ("and running servers plugin also"). Independent of
TEAM-301..303; pairs with TEAM-304.

As a phone-hosted user, I want to see what is running inside the managed
Linux environment and stop what I don't need, so that a stray agent helper
or build daemon cannot burn the battery for an hour unnoticed.

### Impact Table
| Path | Change | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| scripts/termux/manager.sh | modify | `procs-scan` (JSON: pid, parent, group, name, cpu %, rss, elapsed, cwd) and `procs-stop <pid|group>` verbs | Termux `ps -eo` plus rootfs view; groups by ancestry |
| lib/termux/processes.dart | create | Runs the verbs; parses; groups | |
| lib/ui/screens/termux_processes_screen.dart | create | Settings › Termux server › Running now | |
| lib/ui/screens/termux_setup_screen.dart, settings | modify | Entry row with "N processes · CPU x%" | |
| lib/l10n/app_en.arb, docs/qa/ai-team/messages_ar-processes.json | modify/create | `termuxProcs*` keys | |
| test/termux_processes_test.dart | create | Grouping, orphan detection, two-step stop, protected groups | |

Groups (what the owner saw this week): **OpenCode server** (`opencode
serve`, its MCP servers), **AI Team** (gc supervisor, dolt, tmux, per-agent
`opencode acp` + their MCP servers, `gc`/`bd` children), **Build daemons**
(Gradle, Kotlin, dart analysis server, node), **Orphans** (a helper whose
parent is gone or that has used > 5 min CPU with no live parent — the
`minimax-coding-plan-mcp` case), **Other**.

Acceptance Criteria:
- [ ] Scan lists every process the app's Termux user owns, grouped, with CPU
      and memory, refreshed on pull and every 10 s while the screen is open
- [ ] Orphans are flagged with why ("parent exited 42 min ago", "3 h CPU")
      and can be stopped in one tap; stopping a whole group (AI Team, Build
      daemons) is two-step; the OpenCode server and sshd are protected and
      redirect to their own controls
- [ ] Stop sends TERM, waits 5 s, then KILL, and reports what remained
- [ ] Attention: when the app is open and an orphan has burned > 10 min of
      CPU, a Workspace line "Something is still running on this phone" links
      here (no push notification in v1)
- [ ] Quality gates
