# Continuous app improvement

The review and implementation cycle keeps two focused queues:

- [Current delivery state](current-state-2026-09-07.md): reconciled source,
  remaining story acceptance and the active verification record.

- [Execution order and evidence guardrails](roadmap-2026-09-06.md): lead-curated
  next slices, evidence corrections, and held read-only specialist review plan.
- [Epic/story inventory](full-backlog-2026-09-06.md) and
  [innovation inventory](innovation-2026-09-06.md): proposed scope; presence in
  these files is not an implementation or release-readiness claim.
- [Backend](backend.md): protocol adapters, data handling, and connection state.
- [Frontend](frontend.md): useful features, navigation, and everyday interactions.
- [Completed cycles](cycles.md): shipped batches and their verification.
- [V1 release readiness](../v1-release-readiness.md): the full release objective
  and the evidence still needed before it can be marked complete.

Each review pass adds a small number of evidence-backed, deduplicated items.
Stable IDs preserve the history. Ready items contain a specific user problem,
code pointers, an implementation outline, and the smallest useful verification.

The implementation owner takes a coherent batch, marks it in progress, fixes it,
runs focused checks, and records the outcome before committing and pushing.
Completed items stay in their queue as history. Reviewers move to different
areas while the current batch is implemented; they do not edit product code.

Start subsequent cycles from the merged production baseline. Preserve unfinished
work and unrelated artifacts before synchronizing the checkout. Follow repository
merge requirements; do not change protection rules to speed up the cycle.
