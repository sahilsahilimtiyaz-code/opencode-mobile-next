# Fresh-worktree task launch — verification record — 2026-09-08

Branch `feature/isolated-task-launch` on baseline `6a02e7c`. Synthetic
checks only; no server, provider, device or release step ran.

## Contract evidence

| Path | Source | Result |
|---|---|---|
| v1 create | `contracts/opencode-openapi-f12e14cf.json` (upstream `anomalyco/opencode@f12e14cf`, `packages/sdk/openapi.json`): `POST /experimental/worktree?directory=` body `WorktreeCreateInput{name?, startCommand?}` → `Worktree{name, directory, branch?}`; events `worktree.ready{name, branch?}` / `worktree.failed{message}` with `directory` on the global-stream envelope | Callable through the generated SDK (`lib/api/product_repository.dart` `createWorktree`). **Live server exercise still pending.** |
| v2 create | `contracts/opencode2-openapi-beta-18600.json`: `POST /api/worktree/{projectID}` requires `{strategy, directory}` (`additionalProperties: false`) | Adapter sends `{name}` only; no strategy values are enumerated; no local copy of `@opencode-ai/schema@0.0.0-beta-18600` exists and no probe was run. **Unproven → `ServerCapabilities.worktreeCreate = false` on v2.** |

`worktreeCreate` is a capability, not a flavor check: true on v1, false on
v2, Codex and demo. It gates the new launch and the existing Worktrees
"New worktree" action; listing, opening, inspecting, reset and the inspected
`force: false` removal are unchanged.

## Behaviour (see `lib/state/isolated_task_launch.dart`)

- Subscribes to controller events before the create call; a `worktree.ready`
  that beats the create response is retained and applied by directory.
- Correlation: `event.project` must match the project when present;
  directories compared after slash normalization.
- 45 s readiness wait → `unconfirmed`; the user may keep waiting, stop, or
  open anyway. Ready opens the blank session without another tap.
- Cancel and timeout never delete. Cancel before the response does not
  assume rollback: the answer, when it lands, is recorded and the worktree
  stays in the inventory.
- `openSessionInWorktree` is profile-bound, verifies the switched directory,
  requires the current project to resolve to the launching project, and
  checks the created session's project/directory. Nothing is sent.

## Still open

- Live v1 server: create, `worktree.ready` delivery on the global stream, and
  the session opening inside the worktree.
- v2 create body proof before the capability can be enabled there.
- Physical-device journey with keyboard and TalkBack.

## Recovery checkpoint (final source candidate)

The interrupted turn left the changes staged, not committed. Recovery found
no running Flutter/Dart process. The original focused and capture logs above
were complete and were retained, rather than inferred from the interruption.

Before commit, the launch guards were tightened across asynchronous repository
and transport preparation. A changed profile/location cannot retarget the
worktree POST or session POST; a missing current-project response now refuses
session creation. Automatic opening refuses a scope change while readiness is
pending. After an attempted open, Retry explicitly targets the same worktree.
The new sheet imports its types through the domain gateway.

Final checks, using the same pinned environment:

- `dart format lib/state/connection.dart lib/ui/screens/isolated_task_sheet.dart test/isolated_task_sheet_test.dart`: 0 changed.
- `flutter analyze --no-pub`: clean, 17.0 seconds;
  `build/traycer/isolated-recovery-analyze.log`.
- `flutter test --no-pub --concurrency=1 test/isolated_task_sheet_test.dart`:
  14 passed, including four new scope/project guards, using the real controller
  session-creation method rather than overriding it.
- `flutter test --no-pub --concurrency=1 test/isolated_task_launch_test.dart test/isolated_task_sheet_test.dart test/worktrees_screen_test.dart test/l10n_coverage_test.dart test/api2_gateway_mappers_test.dart test/connection_sse_test.dart test/session_selection_sync_test.dart test/chat_live_events_test.dart`:
  **186 passed, 1 failed** in 43 seconds. The original six focused files all
  passed (84 tests on this final candidate). All chat live-event tests passed.
  Log: `build/traycer/isolated-recovery-focused.log`.
- The failing test, `a queued prompt cancelled during selection is never
  delivered`, also fails when rerun alone with `--plain-name`. It expects only
  `model:a:p/saved:` but observes an additional `agent:a:plan`. Its exercised
  queue/selection paths are unchanged by this slice; baseline execution was
  not performed, so this is **not claimed as a proven baseline failure**.
  Assigned back to the integration coordinator for queue-owner triage.
- The 12 saved captures remain applicable: recovery changed no layout or
  displayed captured state. Workspace light and unconfirmed dark were visually
  inspected again; capture generation was not repeated.

The broadened focused run is not green. No full-suite or live-server pass is
claimed. Root owns review, queue-failure triage and the stable integration gate.

## Independent-review correction checkpoint

Corrects the two scope findings against `a4114cc`, without adding prompt sends
or worktree/session deletion. The modal captures controller/profile/base URL,
connection and location revisions, directory and workspace before its builder
runs. An observed pre-Start mismatch permanently retires the sheet, including
a switch away and back. The controller requires that opening scope and checks
the cached project ID/path against a fresh catalog before worktree creation.

Session opening pins the intended no-workspace destination and expected
connection/location revisions before selection; it checks them after selection,
repository preparation, current-project lookup, and transport preparation. This
uses `_selectLocation`'s existing synchronous revision increment before async
hydration. A superseding selection at the same directory cannot be adopted.
Returned sessions carrying a workspace ID are refused for routing.

Validation with pinned Flutter 3.47.2 under the granted serial runtime lease:

- Localization generated and four changed Dart files formatted.
- `isolated_task_sheet_test.dart` plus `isolated_task_launch_test.dart`: **30 passed**.
  Six new regressions cover before-Start profile switch/stale callback, stale
  catalog, catalog-await scope change, and same-directory workspace replacement
  during selection/repository/transport preparation. Existing no-send/no-delete,
  readiness, failure, cancellation and explicit retry cases remain passing.
- `worktrees_screen_test.dart`, `connection_sse_test.dart`,
  `l10n_coverage_test.dart`: **33 passed**.
- `tool/capture/isolated_task_test.dart`: **6 capture cases passed** across the
  initial run and exact two-case correction. Initial Workspace captures failed
  because the new fake returned an immutable list that Workspace sorts; returning
  a mutable fixture list fixed both. Only the two affected Workspace cases were
  rerun. All production source was unchanged after the focused pass.
- `flutter analyze --no-pub`: **no issues**, 16.5 seconds.
- `git diff --check`: clean.

Total **69 focused/capture checks passed**. Logs are ignored local files
`build/traycer/isolated-correction-*.log`. Two new synthetic captures
[light](../qa/isolated-task/sheet-stale-light.png) and
[dark](../qa/isolated-task/sheet-stale-dark.png) show the retired sheet at 320
logical pixels and 2× system text. Both were visually inspected: copy wraps,
Start is absent, and Close remains usable. The existing 12 captures regenerated
without image changes. No full suite or live v1/on-device worktree journey was
run at this correction checkpoint; earlier gate history above is unchanged.
