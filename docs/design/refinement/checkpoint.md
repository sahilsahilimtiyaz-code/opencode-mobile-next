# Maintainer checkpoint — 2026-09-09

The maintainer requested a checkpoint build if the full release was not ready. This checkpoint includes the integrated page refinements, Phosphor actions and launcher identity, shared typography/surfaces, and real bounded frosted navigation with an accessible opaque fallback.

Verified locally: full-app analyzer clean; 50 combined icon/theme/navigation/model checks; 52 combined capture cases; eight actual-font theme goldens; page-slice focused tests and glass reachability/contrast tests; SDK analyzer clean and 47 serial SDK tests. The first final-suite chunk found a stale uppercase Activity heading assertion after the shared sentence-case change. Related section-heading finders were corrected; affected checks and the complete recursive gate must pass on the updated candidate. No complete final-suite pass is claimed yet.

Local native build is blocked: first attempt exhausted Storage during native library merging; the retry using a task-local Gradle cache failed because compiler-generated recorded_uses.json was missing. Release code generation and icon tree-shaking alone are not an APK build pass. Preserve the native quality workflow as a gate.

Checkpoint distribution is authorized through the Android quality workflow using the existing stable CI certificate `2D010C2103CB2F78ABAACA690EAD4D45F8003A6C0A02082CD2A2AE62FD18D0EC`. No production tag, master promotion or public release is requested by this checkpoint. APK checksum/certificate and device verification remain pending.

Original and combined visual evidence, searchable priority ledger, exact gate logs and privacy scan are retained in the sibling oc_app-ui-audit-20260909 folder. The private Tailscale gallery serves curated synthetic captures only. Final capture spot reviews found no serious new integration clipping in their inspected states; large-text chat image coverage remains incomplete.
