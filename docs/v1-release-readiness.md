# V1 release readiness

Objective: release the app with complete feature parity and polished UI/UX.
This is an active delivery checklist, not a claim that the release is ready.
As checked on **13 September 2026**, the stabilization base `5e3b8a4` declares
**1.0.42+47**. GitHub has eight releases, all marked prerelease, and no stable
release. The current stabilization evidence and remaining gates live in
[the candidate record](verification/stable-ui-2026-09-13.md). No signed candidate
or publication is claimed by that source work. The focused 1.0.35+36 CI APK's
[older verification](verification/empty-project-session-recovery-2026-09-07.md)
does not validate later source. The public
[1.0.34+35 release is marked BROKEN](https://github.com/Eslamasabry/opencode-mobile-next/releases/tag/v1.0.34%2B35)
for hidden session access when no projects appear.

Use the [target user and product priorities](product-persona.md) to sequence work:
the primary Android journey is resume, compose, monitor, unblock and review.
Supporting and advanced features remain in the full parity scope.

## Completion evidence

The cycle inventory below is historical implementation evidence. It must be
reconciled against the candidate record before any row is used as release proof.

| Requirement | Evidence needed | Current state |
|---|---|---|
| Supported v1 and v2 workflows work end to end | Current feature matrix reconciled with implementation, protocol fixtures, and live server exercises | Incomplete. Cycle 20 adds searchable active context with pinned-server filtering/read verification; see [context evidence](verification/active-context.md). Cycle 19 adds client skill activation with explicit resume and scope/revert guards; live validation remains pending after empty catalog discovery in the pinned Windows fixture. See [skill evidence](verification/session-skills.md), [backend backlog](backlog/backend.md), the [v2 matrix](opencode2-port-matrix.md), and open feature issues; older phase checkboxes are not sufficient. |
| Large histories and global search remain complete | Multiple-page sessions and messages, including newest messages beyond the old fetch cap | Client pagination implemented: global finder, message history, and scoped v2 session inventory preserve server cursors, including empty pages. Recent, Archived, and command destinations load older sessions; direct session reads cover chats outside loaded inventory. Pinned v1 scoped listing retains its native contract without an invented cursor; its global endpoint has an upstream timestamp-tie limitation documented in the backlog. Final live-server coverage remains part of release verification. |
| Provider setup, catalogs, and MCP setup retain location and recover from failures | Request scope, completed OAuth confirmation, timeout encoding, handled concurrent errors | BE-006–009 implemented. Cycle 13 corrects BE-011: v2 adds at runtime in the selected location, with the restart limit verified live; v1 retains persistent project/global save. Final native workflow verification remains part of release validation. |
| Daily mobile flows preserve input and show current server truth | New-chat commands, refresh failures, connection edits during probes, review selection, per-session model/agent state, resolved requests, unread completions and session notes | Partial: FE-005/006/009 implemented in cycle 03; review selection/patch retention and Files Back in cycle 04. V2 selections and offline snapshots implemented in cycle 07. Staged revert implemented in cycle 08 with pinned-server file/history verification. Cycle 09 implements scoped permission/question sheets and shared reply guards. Cycle 10 implements unread completions, foreground read receipts and privacy opt-out/local fallback. Cycle 11 implements the bounded agent note with draft/conflict protection and pinned-server authorization, size and storage verification. Cycle 16 adds local pinned conversations. Cycle 17 adds the per-server prompt stash and recoverable sent-text history navigation. Cycle 21 makes ordinary text-draft saves acknowledged, server-scoped, serialized and retryable, with no silent capacity eviction; see [draft evidence](verification/draft-recovery.md). Cycle 22 adds automatic attachment recovery using app-private files, explicit partial recovery and save-before-navigation. Cycle 23 adds Android camera/photo-library input and scoped interrupted-picker recovery; see [photo evidence](verification/prompt-photos.md). Cycle 24 adds explicit review and text recovery for ambiguous multi-profile legacy drafts and fixes the camera-recovery startup regression. Native interruption/upgrade validation remains incomplete. Remaining linked workflows and final cross-client/device verification are pending. |
| UI is usable at compact widths and enlarged text | Purposeful rendered review of welcome, chat/composer, providers, workspace/files, permissions/forms, review, and settings | Partial: existing composer evidence plus focused layout checks. Cycle 18 adds inline transcript find, match navigation/highlights, long-message source excerpts and cancellable full-history search; see [search evidence](verification/transcript-search.md). New final release candidate needs a visual pass covering changed flows. |
| Usage totals reflect the selected period and project | Server aggregation, device timezone, empty/error states and capability checks | Cycle 12 implements Settings usage and cost with four calendar ranges, all/current-project scope, tokens, models and tool reliability. Thirty focused checks and the [pinned-server fixture](verification/usage-beta-18600.md) passed. Native timezone plugin integration still needs platform CI and the final device smoke. |
| Complete conversation export and transfer | Full server response, truthful redaction, explicit import destination and conflict behavior | Cycle 14 implements JSON export and verifies both redaction modes against pinned beta-18600. Sanitization replaces original text with placeholders; the UI explains the unredacted backup option. Cycle 15 implements import review and verifies transfer between two servers, source preservation and parent/conflict behavior. Native picker/device smoke remains; mobile import is limited to 128 MiB. See [export evidence](verification/export-beta-18600.md) and [import evidence](verification/import-beta-18600.md). |
| Existing users can install the release predictably | Exact APK package/version/signer/checksum; install and upgrade smoke evidence with data-preservation behavior documented | Not verified for a final release candidate. Preserve the installed signer. Maintainer replacements must retain stable CI certificate `2D010C2103CB2F78ABAACA690EAD4D45F8003A6C0A02082CD2A2AE62FD18D0EC`; never substitute or rotate it. Historical public signing provenance is in the [release notes](release-alpha-notes.md). |
| Final source and artifacts pass release gates | Clean merged commit, full platform CI, Android release build/lint, signed artifact verification and physical-device smoke | Pending final candidate. Prior clean builds are supporting evidence only. |
| Public release is available and accurately documented | Published GitHub release, verified downloadable artifacts, matching tag/source/version, current notes and compatibility limits | Pending stable v1. All eight public release entries inspected on 13 September 2026 are prereleases. Public 1.0.34+35 remains marked BROKEN. Historical preview artifacts do not verify source 1.0.42+47. |

## Delivery order

1. Complete the ready correctness and missing-workflow backlog while keeping both
   protocol adapters working. Reconcile feature issues rather than duplicating
   them or hiding supported features behind permanent capability gates.
2. Verify the implemented pagination and
   model/agent synchronization against live servers;
   reconcile the remaining v2-native surfaces with the captured contract and live
   behavior. Verify claims about MCP persistence before describing them in UI.
3. Perform the final purposeful mobile UX pass, resolve its concrete findings,
   and update release notes from the actual shipped behavior.
4. At a separately approved shipping milestone, build and verify a signed
   candidate through the appropriate workflow, preserve its installed signing
   lineage, and exercise install/upgrade and core flows. Public publication
   requires its own approved release milestone; none is part of this source batch.

Release sources: [historical release notes](release-alpha-notes.md),
[Android release workflow](../.github/workflows/android-release.yml),
[release preflight](../scripts/release.sh), and
[draft release helper](../scripts/cut-alpha.sh). Old public-launch audits contain
historical branch, licensing, and CI claims; inspect current state before using
them as blockers or completion evidence.
