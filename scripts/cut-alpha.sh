# Cut an alpha from an already reviewed and synchronized master branch,
# publish the signed APK, create an immutable tag, and open the GitHub release.
#
# Why this script exists: scripts/release.sh is fail-closed by design — it
# demands a clean synced master, the private signing identity, and Shorebird,
# and it never creates GitHub releases or tags. The private key is kept
# outside the repository and outside this script's reach on purpose; an
# agent cannot cut a release alone, and should not be able to.
#
# Prerequisites (checked, never worked around):
#   * android/key.properties present with the legacy GitHub sideload key
#     (certificate SHA-256 842284b27aa297fb74cf831779fd16498517e1bc2104451459fec2ea7ac11d1c)
#   * Shorebird CLI installed and authenticated (shorebird doctor)
#   * gh CLI installed and authenticated (only needed for --publish)
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/cut-alpha.sh              # preflight + dry-run, uploads nothing
#   ./scripts/cut-alpha.sh --publish    # publish + immutable tag + release
#   ./scripts/cut-alpha.sh --print-notes  # assemble + validate the release body only
#
# Everything is fail-closed. The script never merges or pushes source changes;
# master must already be the exact reviewed release commit.
#
# The release body is read from HEAD with `git show` (no pipe, so a failure
# aborts under `set -e`), must carry the alpha heading and at least
# NOTES_MIN_LINES lines before anything is published, and is read back from
# GitHub after `gh release create` — a truncated body once shipped because a
# failed `git show` inside a pipeline produced an empty file that was
# uploaded anyway.
