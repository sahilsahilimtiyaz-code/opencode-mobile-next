/// The AI Team plugin's controller: one per profile whose
/// [ServerProfile.orchestration] is set, constructed and disposed by
/// `ConnectionController` and never embedded in it (04-plugin-architecture
/// §1, §9).
///
/// Lifecycle: [start] probes the host, builds the adapter for the
/// configured provider, subscribes to its event stream and refreshes every
/// scope. Events do not carry data into the snapshot; they mark scopes
/// dirty and a short debounce refetches only those (§5). The timeline is
/// append-only from events and bounded. [stop] closes the gateway;
/// [remove] also sweeps the profile's store so turning the plugin off
/// leaves no trace.
///
/// Writes (TEAM-202, §6) go through [mutate] and its typed helpers
/// ([answerGate], [messageAgent], [controlAgent], [cancelRun],
/// [assignWork]): a [MutationRecord] with a fresh idempotency key is
/// persisted BEFORE the gateway is called, the receipt updates it, and the
/// host's matching `request.result` event (or the effect's own event)
/// marks it confirmed. A record still sent after [mutationTimeout] becomes
/// unconfirmed; so does every sent record found on restart. Nothing is
/// ever re-sent by the controller: [retryMutation] makes a new record
/// under a new key and only when a person asks.
///
/// Merge (TEAM-205): [mergeReadiness] reads the host front's readiness
/// document per run and caches it until [refresh]; [approveMergeRequest]
/// and [mergeRun] are ordinary mutations through the same path, allowed
/// only when the adapter implements [OrchestrationMergeGateway].
///
/// Policy (TEAM-207): [policy] is the host's read-only supervision level
/// and boundaries, read with the projects scope on every refresh when the
/// adapter implements [OrchestrationPolicyGateway] (a host front) and
/// null otherwise, so the run overview and the Start-a-run sheet show the
/// host's rules or nothing.
///
/// Dispatch cycle (TEAM-116): [cycleFor] derives where a work item is in
/// the host's dispatch chain (routed → agent starting → claimed → working
/// → pushed → handed to merge → merged) and why it waits, from the
/// snapshot, the timeline and the agent's transcript. Cycles are derived
/// on demand and cached until the next event, refresh or tick; the tick
/// ([cycleTick], 30 s) runs only while a strip watches ([watchCycles]) and
/// some cycle is still moving, and while watched the controller reads the
/// transcript of an agent that claimed but has not pushed, so a provider
/// usage limit surfaces as the stall reason without anyone opening the
/// output.
