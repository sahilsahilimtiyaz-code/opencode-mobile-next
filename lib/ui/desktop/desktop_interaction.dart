/// exactly where that is true and falls back to Material's behaviour
/// otherwise. Horizontal strips keep the plain treatment: a permanent bar
/// under a row of chips is noise, not affordance.
///
/// Mouse is deliberately *not* added to [dragDevices]. Drag-to-scroll with a
/// mouse would take the same gesture desktop users expect to select text with,
/// and the transcript's selection support depends on that gesture. Wheel and
/// trackpad scrolling need no configuration — they arrive as pointer signals
/// and pan/zoom events, not drags.
