/// The single place that answers "does the platform this build is running on
/// actually have that?".
///
/// This app is primarily an Android client for OpenCode with a Linux desktop
/// target bolted on. A large share of its features are Android platform
/// features — a Termux bridge, a foreground service, notification actions, a
/// home-screen widget, Shorebird code push, on-device voice — reached through
/// `MethodChannel`s that simply have no implementation in the Linux runner.
/// Left ungated, every one of those surfaces is visible on the desktop build
/// and does nothing, or worse, claims to have worked.
///
/// The gates therefore route through one small object rather than through
/// `Platform.isAndroid` scattered across the widget tree, for three reasons:
///
///  * `dart:io`'s `Platform` is invisible to widget tests — it reports the
///    *host* (Linux), so an Android-only branch guarded that way is never
///    exercised by the suite, which is how the untruths got in.
///  * The booleans are named after the *capability*, not the OS. When iOS or
///    a Windows runner arrives, the answer changes in one file.
///  * Tests can pump both platforms: [debugPlatformCapabilities] swaps the
///    whole object out.
///
/// It is deliberately derived from [defaultTargetPlatform] rather than
/// `Platform`: `defaultTargetPlatform` honours
/// `debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride`, is the value the Flutter framework
/// itself branches on, and reports `TargetPlatform.android` inside
/// `flutter_test` — so the Android paths stay the tested default and desktop
/// is the case a test opts into.
